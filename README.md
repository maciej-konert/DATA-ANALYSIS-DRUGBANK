# **DrugBank Data Analysis - Python Project**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project is a part of my Python course and focuses on analyzing drug-related data from DrugBank. The tasks were originally given in another language and have been automatically translated into English. You can find the translated task description in the `project_task.pdf` file.  

## **How to Run the Project**  
To execute the project, follow these steps:  

1. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**  
   The main analysis is in the following notebooks:  
   - `Main.ipynb` â†’ Contains most of the tasks.  
   - `Randomized_Simulation.ipynb` â†’ Generates a random DrugBank database of a specified size.  

   To start Jupyter Notebook, run:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## **Running the Tests**  
Tests are located in the `tests/` folder. To run them, use:  
```bash
pytest tests/test_drugbank_parser.py
```

## **Dataset Information**  
This project uses a **downloaded subset of 100 drugs** from DrugBank. If you want access to the full dataset, you can find it at:
